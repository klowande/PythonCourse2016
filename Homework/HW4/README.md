# HW4
Fourth homework, due end of the day Thursday, August 25th. Commit to GitHub often with meaningful comments. Michelle is under no obligation to comment on late work.

You will have to figure out how to plot in this lab. Try to write these algorithms without copying code, but of course look things up or ask questions if you get really stuck.
